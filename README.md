# SubW0iScan
Once you have a list of your target's subdomains, this tool will perform multiple WHOIS queries to determine the domain name, network name, domain IP, IP range and country, and then export the results to a csv file if desired.
This can easily help determine which domains are up and their IP addresses, whether a domain is hosted by the target organization or a third party, the physical location of the target's servers, and the IP address range of the target's domain.
## Usage
```python SubWh0iScan.py -d subdomains-list.txt -o subdomains-info.csv```
